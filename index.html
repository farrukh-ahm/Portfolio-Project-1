                    Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila, is situated in Old Delhi, India. 
                    It was built by the Mughal Emperror Shah Jahan, who comissioned for its construction on 12th May 1638, 
                    when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. 
                    It served as the main residence of the Mugahl Emperors and representst the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan, 
                    and combined Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.
                    <br>
                    The fort's massive red sandstone walls, which stand 75 feet (23 metres) high, enclose a complex of palaces and entertainment halls, 
                    projecting balconies, baths and indoor canals, and geometrical gardens, as well as an ornate mosque. 
                    Among the most famous structures of the complex are the Hall of Public Audience (Diwan-i-Ê¿Am), 
                    which has 60 red sandstone pillars supporting a flat roof, and the Hall of Private Audience (Diwan-i-Khas), 
                    which is smaller and has a pavilion of white marble.
                    <br>
                    The fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2007.

                    The World Heritage Convention characterises the Red Fort as representing "the zenith of Mughal creativity". 
                    The fort synthesises Islamic palace structure with local traditions, resulting in a confluence of "Persian, Timurid, and Hindu architecture". 
                    The fort served as an inspiration for later buildings and gardens across the Indian subcontinent.
                    <br> 
                    The fort's artwork synthesises Persian, European and Indian art, resulting in a unique Shahjahani style rich in form, expression and colour. 
                    Red Fort is one of the building complexes of India encapsulating a long period of history and its arts.

                    The Lahori and Delhi Gates were used by the public, and the Khizrabad Gate was for the emperor. 
                    The Lahori Gate is the main entrance, leading to a domed shopping area known as the Chatta Chowk (covered bazaar).

                    The Red Fort, the largest monument in Delhi, is one of its most popular tourist destinations and attracts thousands of visitors every year. 
                    It is a monument of national significance; every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the Prime Minister of India hoists 
                    the country's flag at the Red Fort and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts.
                    <br>
                    The mosque and hammam or public baths are closed to the public, although visitors can peer through their glass windows or marble latticework. 
                    Walkways are crumbling, and public toilets are available at the entrance and inside the park. 
                    The Lahori Gate entrance leads to a mall with jewellery and craft stores. 
                    There is also a museum of "blood paintings", depicting young 20th-century Indian martyrs and their stories, 
                    an archaeological museum and an Indian war-memorial museum.
