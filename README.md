## Testing
The website has been tested on different devices and screen sizes, eg. 21.5inch monitor, 15in laptop screen, iPad and Android Devices.

-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Ffarrukh-ahm.github.io%2FPortfolio-Project-1%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

## Known Bugs
On some iPhone devices, the buttons on the Form page does not display properly. This is mostly due to the higher pixel density on iPhones. Attempted to resolve this by using more media queries with different width and webkit device pixel ratio, but it didn't work. It's difficult to properly fix this issue as it dispalys properly on Chrome and Firefox's dev tools with simulated mobile screens, including iPhone screens. However, upon deploying and opening the website on the actual iPhone device itself, it shows issues. This will need further investigation. No other known bugs were found after numerous testings.
