                <p>Qutab Minar is a soaring, 73 m-high tower of victory, built in 1193 by Qutab-ud-din Aibak immediately after the defeat of Delhi's last Hindu kingdom. 
                    The tower has five distinct storeys, each marked by a projecting balcony and tapers from a 15 m diameter at the base to just 2.5 m at the top. 
                    The first three storeys are made of red sandstone; the fourth and fifth storeys are of marble and sandstone. 
                    At the foot of the tower is the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, the first mosque to be built in India. 
                    An inscription over its eastern gate provocatively informs that it was built with material obtained from demolishing '27 Hindu temples'. 
                    A 7 m-high iron pillar stands in the courtyard of the mosque. It is said that if you can encircle it with your hands while standing with your back 
                    to it your wish will be fulfilled.</p>

                <p> A stunning archway standing as a tribute to the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country, India Gate is one of the landmarks of Delhi. 
                    Built with sandstone, this 42-m-high gate was the first of its kind in the national capital. The walls of the gateway have been inscribed with the names of 
                    13,516 soldiers killed in the Northwestern Frontier in the Afghan war of 1919, besides 90,000 soldiers of the Indian Army who were martyred in World War I. 
                    The base of the monument is made of red Bharatpur stones and the structure of India Gate is similar to France's Arc- de- Triomphe.
                    India Gate is fringed by lush well-maintained lawns that act as a popular picnic venue for families. The best time to visit this monument is at night when 
                    it is bathed in soft golden lights and glistens in the dark star-less sky.

                <p>
                    This great mosque of Old Delhi is the largest in India, with a courtyard capable of holding 25,000 devotees. 
                    It was begun in 1644 and ended up being the final architectural extravagance of Shah Jahan, 
                    the Mughal emperor who built the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort.
                    The highly decorative mosque has three great gates, four towers and two 40 m-high minarets constructed of strips of red sandstone and
                    white marble. Travellers can hire robes at the northern gate. This may be the only time you get to dress like a local without feeling like 
                    an outsider so make the most of it.
                    <br>
                    Having been built on a hill, the mosque is situated on a plinth elevated 10 metres above the surrounding city. 
                    The complex is oriented such that the back wall faces the west, towards Mecca. 
                    An imperial college, imperial dispensary, and madrasa used to lie adjacent to the structure, but were destroyed in the uprisings of 1857

                <p> Humayun's Tomb, Delhi is the first of the grand dynastic mausoleums that were to become synonyms of Mughal architecture with the architectural 
                    style reaching its zenith 80 years later at the later Taj Mahal.
                    <br>
                    Humayun's Tomb was built in the 1560's, with the patronage of Humayun's son, the great Emperor Akbar. 
                    Persian and Indian craftsmen worked together to build the garden-tomb, far grander than any tomb built before in the Islamic world. 
                    Humayun's garden-tomb is an example of the charbagh (a four quadrant garden with the four rivers of Quranic paradise represented), 
                    with pools joined by channels. The garden is entered from lofty gateways on the south and from the west with pavilions located in the 
                    centre of the eastern and northern walls.
